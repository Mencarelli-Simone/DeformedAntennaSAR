# Project progress:
## Abstract
compute the Azimuth impulse response (over range) for
a deformed antenna processing the signal with 
the nominal antenna pattern matched filter.
Also consider effects on SNR and resolution loss. 

## steps / scripts

- **ffsFileReader:** a script to parse CST 
far field source files into an antenna object for
SAR performance evaluation. 

- **deformedAntennaAIR:** (Azimuth impulse response)

- TBD SNR stuff
